IS 445 - Data Visualization 
Final Project

After a semester of IS445, my biggest takeaway is understanding the power of data manipulation and how minor changes can impact the perception of a subject. Before taking this course, I did not realize the large impact that color and shading can have on a story. In the society we live in, we associate different colors with different things (Democrat/Republican or Male/Female). The exclusion and inclusion of certain variables can potentially mislead an audience into believing something false. Iâ€™ve learned that transparency in making data visualizations is very important and data requires context. 

One aspect that could be improved on is learning how to code and debug more visualization types in class. A lot of the python learning happened outside of class and I think it would be helpful to go over more of the basics in class where we can ask questions. I found myself struggling with not knowing how to fix my code and not knowing which functions to use to do certain things. More in class instruction with this would specifically help those who are more beginner at coding and python since prior knowledge was also not a requirement to take this class. Also, I think it would also help to have a list of packages that people use for data visualizations and how to use them. Besides this, I enjoyed the class and learned a lot about creating visuals.
